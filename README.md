# Plant-Phenotype-Prediction-in-Arabidopsis-thaliana
This project was done as part of the "Artifical intelligence for Biotechnology" course at Technical University of Munich, Straubing Campus. The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting the phenotypic responses of individual plants by analyzing the genetic variations in the plant samples available. For this, we utilized authentic data from the 1001 Genomes Project for _Arabidopsis thaliana_. The 1001 Genomes Consortia has completely sequenced numerous _Arabidopsis thaliana_ samples, identifying the genetic variances among them (Alonso-Blanco et al., 2016). We have selected 5000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and created an in silico phenotype related to biomass as our dataset. The biomass for each plant is quantified in grams (g).
